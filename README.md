# Dependabot Update Script

This repo contains a [simple script][script] that demonstrates
[Dependabot Core][dependabot-core]. It is intended to give you a feel for how
Dependabot Core works so that you can use it in your own project.

If you're looking for a hosted, feature-rich version then you probably want
[Dependabot][dependabot] itself.

# Usage

* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec irb`
* Copy and paste the script into the Ruby session to see how Dependabot works

[script]: update-script.rb
